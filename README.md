In November 2023, I raced and completed my first triathlon at Morro Bay!

At my finish, I became hungry for more and wanted to optimize training for myself and other triathletes.

This project uses scraped data from morrobaytri.com (with finish times from 2015-2017) to predict an athletes biking time based on their running and swimming capabilities.

I also delve into the age of participants and have concluded that, for triathletes, age is just a number! 
Older athletes have historically performed just as well as younger participants.
